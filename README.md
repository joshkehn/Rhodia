# Rhodia

Rhodia is a logger for the browser. An exceptionally simple logger. So simple it might be *to* simple.

There is much beauty in simplicity, but if you find a feature you just *must absolutely have* and think is a good idea please open an issue and let me know.

### Disclaimer

There are probably other client side loggers. Are they any good? I can't really say. I haven't tried them. This is a work-in-progress.

### About The Name

The name comes from the paper and notebook maker [Rhodia](http://rhodiapads.com/). Famous for using high quality paper wrapped in a very distinctive orange. They are a subsidiary of Clairefontaine, but I thought it would be easier to type Rhodia.

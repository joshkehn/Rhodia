# Rhodia

Rhodia is a logger for the browser. An exceptionally simple logger. So simple it might be *to* simple.

There is much beauty in simplicity, but if you find a feature you just *must absolutely have* and think is a good idea please open an issue and let me know.

### Disclaimer

There are probably other client side loggers. Are they any good? I can't really say. I haven't tried them. This is a work-in-progress.
